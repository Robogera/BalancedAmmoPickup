# BalancedAmmoPickup
This is a mod for Payday2 that changes the ammo pickup values of different high damage (100+) weapons to match the ammo-per-box to damage ratio of low damage weapons, making them more usable for higher difficulties. The mod is client-side only

Currently it only affects the assault rifles, SMGs and their akimbo variants

This mod requires SuperBLT
